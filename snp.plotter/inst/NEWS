snp.plotter 0.3.1 - 2010-11-22
---------------------------

- Changed dependency back from GeneticsBase because GeneticsBase is not in the Bioconductor 2.7 release. The genetics package produces a obselete package warning; only the LD and genotype functions of the genetics package are used. 

snp.plotter 0.4 - 2011-05-11
---------------------------

- Support for scaling SNP names and symbols added making it easier to draw diagrams with a greater number of SNPs.
