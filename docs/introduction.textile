h1. Introduction

h2. What is snp.plotter? 

snp.plotter is an R package that creates publishable-quality plots of p-values using single SNP and/or haplotype data. Main features of the package include options to display a linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot and the ability to plot multiple sets of results simultaneously. Plots can be created using global and/or individual haplotype p-values along with single SNP p-values. Images are created as either "Portable Document Format (PDF)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf or "Encapsulated (EPS) files":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript.

h2. What do snp.plotter images look like?

Here is a sample image as both a PDF and a EPS image. PDF images can be viewed using the free "Adobe Reader":http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.html software. EPS (or PDF) images can be viewed using front-end software for "Ghostscript":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/, a Postscript and PDF interpreter: "Ghostview and GV":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ for Unix/X11 systems and "GSView":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ for Windows.

h2. Who are the intended users of snp.plotter?

Researchers conducting gene association studies who need to create images showing results in the form of p-values of their work along with a "linkage disequilibrium":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium plot to show the underlying structure of the study population. Because snp.plotter is a visualization tool, the type of study design used either family-based, case-control, or a combination is irrelevant.
