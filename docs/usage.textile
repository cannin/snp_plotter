h2. How do I install snp.plotter?

snp.plotter requires the installation of R, the statistical computing software, freely available "here":http://www.r-project.org/ for Linux, Windows, or MacOS. snp.plotter uses three contributed packages: grid, lattice, and genetics available from the R Project website. snp.plotter can be downloaded "CRAN":http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snp.plotter/index.html. Packages in the current working directory of R can be installed using the *install.packages* command.

In *Windows,* make sure that you have downloaded the .zip version of a package, which is a pre-compiled binary. Change the word *PACKAGE_FILENAME* to the name of the package being installed.

@install.packages("PACKAGE_FILENAME.zip", repos=NULL)@

In *Unix/Linux,* make sure that you have downloaded a source package, the .tar.gz version, of a package. Change the word *PACKAGE_FILENAME* to the name of the package being installed.

@install.packages("PACKAGE_FILENAME.tar.gz", repos=NULL)@

The following error indicates that additional packages need to be installed: *PACKAGE_FILENAME* can be grid or genetics. These packages can be downloaded from "CRAN":http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html. and installed using the same process described above.

@Error: package 'PACKAGE_FILENAME' could not be loaded@

h2. How is snp.plotter used?

Once snp.plotter and its dependencies are installed, snp.plotter can be loaded into R using this command:

@library(snp.plotter)@

snp.plotter is then run using the following command. Explanation of snp.plotter configuration files and input files is provided in the [[file formats|File-Formats]] section. The configuration file specifies all the characteristics for the plot to be produced and the names of the data files to be used as input. Example "configuration and input files":https://github.com/downloads/cannin/snp_plotter/snp.plotter.20SNP.dataset.zip are also provided.

@snp.plotter(config.file="config.txt")@

Information about the configuration options is provided in the "documentation on CRAN":http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snp.plotter/snp.plotter.pdf, which can viewed from within R using this command.

@?snp.plotter@

h2. How do I incorporate the snp.plotter figures into my publication?

The listing below shows the most common scenarios for inclusion of a figure into a publication; methods will vary based on the intended publication type:

* *Inclusion of PDF into Word document:* PDF images can be selected and copied using the Adobe Reader snapshot tool. These images can then be pasted into a Word document.
* *Inclusion of PDF/EPS into LaTeX document:* Images included into DVI file using *latex* must be in the EPS format. PDF documents created by *pdflatex* cannot use files in the EPS format and requires the PDF format. The following is basic LaTeX code for including an image. *FILENAME* must be changed to the appropriate filename.

<pre><code>\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{FILENAME}
\end{figure}
\end{document}
</code></pre>

* *Conversion of PDF/EPS file into other formats using Ghostscript:* Ghostscript can be used to convert PDF and EPS files into a variety of raster formats such as JPG, BMP, PNG, etc. The following commandline converts an EPS image into a JPG image; the resulting image has a resolution of 300 DPI and pixel dimension of 1050x1050 pixels. Further information on the usage of Ghostscript can be found "here":http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/8.00/Use.htm. *FILENAME* must be changed to the appropriate filename.
